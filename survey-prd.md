## 1. Executive Summary

The Adaptive Survey is the cornerstone of My AI Onboarding's personalization engine.

Unlike traditional static surveys, our system uses branching logic to ask only relevant questions, making the experience feel like a conversation with an onboarding specialist.

### Core Philosophy
"We're not asking about AI skills. We're understanding how you work, so we can show you when AI can help."
